👋 Hi, I’m @h2colby

👀 I’m interested in revolutionizing hydrogen energy through innovative electrolyzer technology and renewable energy solutions.//
🌱 I’m currently working on Tobe Energy, focused on clean hydrogen production and the development of cold electrolysis technology./
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of renewable energy, hydrogen tech, and sustainable systems./
📫 You can reach me on twitter or instagram @h2colby, LinkedIn @colbydeweese or through Tobe Energy./
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve developed a novel electrolysis process that significantly improves hydrogen production efficiency & working full time towards commercialization, and I’m also working on a hydrogen textbook to help others better understand the potential of this incredible resource.
